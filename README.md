Eracha Project
==============

This is a little project to reverse engineer parts of the ERACHA platformer,
made by korean game developers Mirinae Software and released for DOS in 1996.
There has also been a re-release on CD-Rom by Green Pepper and a demo version.

Currently, it only contains assorted notes about the used file formats and
some hacked up helper programs to deal with them. There are extractor and
converter utilities in the tools directory (in alpha stage).

The goal is to create an cross platform interpreter of the game sometime.

Legal Disclaimer
----------------

I know that the game is not Freeware and therefore I will not provide any
of the original files, also not a dump of unpacked files from the archive
formats.
It is in your responsibility to get the data files from your floppy disk/cd or
any of the abandonware websites.
Considering the company has closed down several years ago and nobody is done
any harm by this, I can release all tools and even an interpreter of the
data files free of charge.

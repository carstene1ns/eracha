Eracha Project
==============

This is a little project to reverse engineer parts of the ERACHA platformer,
made by korean game developers Mirinae Software and released for DOS in 1996.

Currently, it only contains assorted notes about the used file formats and
some hacked up helper programs to deal with them.
Currently there is an extractor and a converter utility (both alpha stage).

The goal is to create an cross platform interpreter of the game sometime.

Legal Disclaimer
----------------

I know that the game is not Freeware and therefore I will not provide any
of the original files, also not unpacked files from the archive formats.
It is in your responsibility to get the data files from your floppy disk or
any of the abandonware websites.
Considering the company has closed down several years ago and nobody is done
any harm by this, I can release all tools and even an interpreter of the
data files free of charge.

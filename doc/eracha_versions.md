ERACHA Versions
===============

There have been different releases/versions, I have at least found 4.
There may be more, if you found/own one, feel free to contact me.


DEMO
----

I do not know, if this had a proper release at all, found it on the net.
Source file dates are between July 1995 and February 1996.

It is bare in some aspects, for example:

 - No readme file
 - No archive format
 - sounds are in VOC subfolder
 - various "SaemSong" references for example in Loading Screen (working title?)


Release 1996
------------

The original release. I own the version released in germany.
Most of the information in this doc folder assumes this version.
Source file dates are between September 1995 and June 1996, while most files
have been modified after the demo release in February 1996.

Second Release (Green Pepper) 20XX
----------------------------------

I have currently no access to this version, as I do not own a copy.


Hacked/Cracked/Modified/Warez
-----------------------------

These are assumptions, because I found this version uploaded to an abandonware
site (group name is ZYLON) and do not know what has modified at all:

 - Most images are in PCX format and have some poorly translated strings

Source file dates are between June 1995 and February 1997, additionally the
images have been modified June/July 1997. ERACHA.EXE has been modified with the
release date of the group in November 1997.
